# PC Starterpack
Set up my PC as quickly and painlessly as possible. Intended to be used with Ubuntu-based distros (developed on Kubuntu 24.04 LTS)

## Usage
Install the base OS with a USB key, selecting the complete install (with extra programs). Clone this repo and cd into the folder. Then:

```bash
./install.sh
```

...put in your sudo password and wait for everything to install. You may need to sudo multiple times depending on how long everything takes. It'll ask you if you want to reboot at the end, you should generally hit Enter to confirm but if there are other important things going on in the background then it's ok to wait. Once rebooted, copy over all of your files and you're done!
